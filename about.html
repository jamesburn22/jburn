    <h2>TLDR of Warcraft Expansions</h2>

    <h3>Warcraft I: Orcs & Humans</h3>
    <p>Some green guys (orcs) show up through a magic door to beat up the humans in Azeroth. Humans say, “Nah, bro!” but it turns out one of their own, Medivh, is helping the orcs. Medivh gets axed by his buddies, but the humans lose anyway and run north. Now everybody’s mad and ready for round two.</p>

    <h3>Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness</h3>
    <p>Orcs, now with a new boss named Doomhammer, try again, but humans got friends—elves and dwarves this time. Big ugly orc Gul’dan ditches his own side for power, so the humans win, and the orcs get put in camps. Dark Portal gets blown up, and things quiet down. But let’s be real; it's not over yet.</p>

    <h3>Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal</h3>
    <p>Orcs think, "Let's do this again!" and reopen the Dark Portal, planning to swipe some powerful stuff. Humans follow them into their own backyard, Outland, to shut this down. Things go boom, Outland goes to hell, and some heroes are stuck there forever.</p>

    <h3>Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos</h3>
    <p>Evil demons, the Burning Legion, stir the pot by turning Prince Arthas into a bad guy. Meanwhile, orcs under Thrall go, “Let’s stop being evil,” and head to Kalimdor for a new start. Night elves pop out like, “Stay off our lawn!” but everyone ends up teaming up to stop the demons. Big bad Archimonde eats a face-full of tree magic and gets toasted.</p>

    <h3>Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne</h3>
    <p>Arthas, now Lich King 2.0, merges with some dead guy's spirit to lead the Scourge. Some crazy elf named Illidan tries to smack him down but fails, runs off to Outland, and sets up shop. Everyone’s picking sides, and Arthas chills in the cold, getting ready for more bad stuff.</p>

    <h3>World of Warcraft: Classic/Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Years pass, and everybody's like, "Peace was boring," so they start scrapping again. Old evils wake up, like zombie armies, dragons, and giant bug gods. New threats, more loot, and bigger grudges keep everybody busy. Meanwhile, whispers of the Dark Portal reopening have folks sweating bullets.</p>

    <h3>The Burning Crusade</h3>
    <p>Portal reopens, and it's back to Outland for a rematch with Illidan, Kael'thas, and some demon nonsense. Blood Elves join the Horde, Draenei join the Alliance, and it’s a big intergalactic reunion. Illidan gets punked, and Kael’thas tries bringing a demon lord to Azeroth—bad call, bro. Heroes shut him down just in time.</p>

    <h3>Wrath of the Lich King</h3>
    <p>Lich King Arthas says, “Hey, remember me?” and starts wrecking stuff from Northrend. Everybody gangs up to raid his icy crib, dealing with zombies, spider dudes, and his whole mess. Big paladin Tirion gets the final smack in, and Arthas is toast. New guy Bolvar goes, “I got this,” and takes the crown of misery.</p>

    <h3>Cataclysm</h3>
    <p>Big dragon Deathwing wakes up cranky and smashes everything to pieces, causing earthquakes, floods, and fire everywhere. Alliance and Horde are too busy punching each other to really focus on him at first. After wrestling elementals, Old Gods, and lots of fire, they finally take him down. World’s kinda busted, but at least he’s gone.</p>

    <h3>Mists of Pandaria</h3>
    <p>A bunch of ships crash into a hidden continent called Pandaria, and the locals, the kung-foo Pandaren, aren’t thrilled. Garrosh Hellscream, Horde's new psycho boss, decides to go full dictator mode and makes things worse. Alliance and Horde unite to kick him to the curb before he ruins everything.</p>

    <h3>Warlords of Draenor</h3>
    <p>Garrosh goes back in time (long story) and starts an alternate-reality orc army called the Iron Horde. Everybody time-travels to stop him, running into new bad guys, old bad guys, and the usual demon drama. Gul’dan screws things up and brings demons back to Azeroth again. Heroes save the day... kind of.</p>

    <h3>Legion</h3>
    <p>Demons come back—this time, like, everyone—and it's a full-blown apocalypse led by a crazy Titan named Sargeras. All the factions go “Avengers Assemble!” with magic weapons and demon-hunting elves to fight back. They break the Legion, save some planets, and kick Sargeras to the curb. But Azeroth’s got a giant stab wound now, so...not great.</p>

    <h3>Battle for Azeroth</h3>
    <p>Horde and Alliance just can't chill and go to war after some serious atrocities like burning trees and cities. They seek new friends in Kul Tiras and Zandalar and uncover ancient threats. Oh, and an Old God, N'Zoth, breaks free and tries to mess everyone up. Big epic battle later, Old God gets taken down—again, but now everyone’s scarred and paranoid.</p>

    <h3>Shadowlands</h3>
    <p>Sylvanas breaks the cycle of life and death, and everyone's dragged into the Shadowlands—basically the afterlife, but with quest zones. Everybody fights spooky stuff, deals with old grudges, and tries to stop the Jailer, who's got some weird plan to rewrite everything. After some soul-searching (literally), they smack down the Jailer and deal with Sylvanas. Shadowlands are back to “normal,” whatever that means. Oh and Anduin gets PTSD.</p>

    <h3>Dragonflight</h3>
    <p>Dragons are like, “We're back, baby!” and return to their ancient homeland, the Dragon Isles. They want their powers back to handle whatever cosmic stuff is next. New threats and ancient mysteries start popping up, and everyone has to gear up again. There's these primordial dragon dudes and they get an artifact called the Dark Heart. They give it to shadow goth mommy with stinky feet and here we are.</p>

    <h3>The Worldsoul Saga</h3>
    <p>The next three expansion to come out are apart of the Worldsoul Saga.  These expansion are The War Within(2024), Midnight(2026), and The Last Titan(TBD). These three expansion revolve around the fate of Azeroth's world-soul, the true long-term intentions of the Pantheon of Order, a potential final, apocalpytic confrontation between the Light and the V oid, and many other story hooks. </p>
