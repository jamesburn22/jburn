    <main class="content">
        <p>
            World of Warcraft has always been more than a game to me, it's a world I escape to when I want adventure, nostalgia, or just a break from real life. 
            From the moment I created my first character and stepped into Azeroth, I was hooked.
        </p>

        <p>Here are a few of my favorite things about the game:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Main Character:</strong> I usually play as a <em>Nightbourne Warlock</em>, a damage dealing spell caster class.</li>
            <li><strong>Favorite Zones:</strong> Ironforge and Grizzly Hills are my go-to places. The music and scenery always hit me with nostalgia.</li>
            <li><strong>Best Moments:</strong> Running raids with friends at 2 AM, wiping over and over until we finally got the boss down.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Fun Fact about Warlocks:</strong> They are magical practitioners that seek to understand darker magics, such as fel-based and destructive spells. 
            While many warlocks willingly follow the Burning Legion, there are those who work against it, using their magic to fight against evil.
        </p>

        <p>
            One thing that makes the game special is how it connects people. I’ve met friends through guilds, random groups, and even world PvP.
