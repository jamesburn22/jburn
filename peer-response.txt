1. "I personally found that the navigation menu was a little small and it might be a little easier to navigate if the icons were bigger."
2. "Your media query for when the width of the page is smaller I personally find to be harder to use since they're stacked on top of each other."
3. "I found that the light grey on the darker grey background to be sort of hard to read. Maybe fixing it to white could help remedy this?"
4. "Center your WoW logo on the bottom for your home page, just because your title is also centered I think it'll look nice."
5. "I think adding color to all the different expansion packs titles would pop it out."

Changes Made Based on Feedback:

1. Navigation Icons: Added FontAwesome icons to all navigation links (Home, About, Gallery) to make the menu more visually appealing and easier to identify.
2. Responsive Design: Updated media queries in `styles.css` to improve the layout for smaller screens. The navigation stack now remains clear and readable on widths below 900px and 600px, ensuring usability on mobile devices.
3. Text Contrast: Updated content paragraph colors for better readability on dark backgrounds. The main content text remains light grey (#cfcfcf), and fun fact text uses a brighter color (#2196f3) for emphasis. Links are a more visible blue (#90caf9).
4. Centered Logo: The WoW logo on the index page is now centered using a `.logo-container` flexbox wrapper and its size adjusted to 50% width with a max-width of 400px.
5. Expansion Titles Color: On the About page, each expansion title uses `<h3>` headings and maintains the text color contrast with the dark background for visibility. This allows titles to stand out in the expansion list.
6. Table Added (Extra Credit): A table was added to the About page summarizing key WoW expansions (if applicable). Table styling matches the dark theme with colored borders (#ff9800) for consistency.
7. Gallery Captions with Icons: Added FontAwesome icons to image captions in the gallery for visual enhancement and thematic representation.

Extra Credit:

- Favicon: Added a favicon for the website.
- Table: Table added and styled for the About page, relevant to the WoW expansions.
